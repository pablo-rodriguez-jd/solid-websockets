Yahoo's [Pure](http://purecss.io/) is a set of small, responsive CSS modules that you can use in every web project.

`purecss-sass` is a Sass-powered version of Pure CSS for your applications. It allows to include all of Pure components at once or load them individually. Tested and working with Ruby on Rails, Compass, Sprockets, Bower, npm etc.

Original Pure CSS files are converted using `sass-convert` and otherwise untouched and unmodified.

## Installation

* [Ruby on Rails](#ruby-on-rails)
* [Bower](#bower)
* [npm](#npm)

### Ruby on Rails

Open your Rails application's `Gemfile` and add this line:

```ruby
gem 'purecss-sass'
```

Save `Gemfile` and execute `bundle` command to install the gem.

Open `/app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss` file and add this line:

```scss
@import 'purecss';
```

> Note: Default Rails installation comes with `.css` file extension for stylesheet assests files, make sure you change it to `.scss` and remove all the `*= require_tree .` and `*= require_self` statements from file. Alternatively, to keep original `application.css` file, you can create `custom.scss` file in the same folder and import `purecss` there.

Restart Rails web server if it was running and now your Rails application is powered by Pure CSS for Sass.

### Bower

To install `purecss-sass` Bower package execute this command:
```
bower install purecss-sass
```

Then you will have a local copy of `purecss-sass` stylesheets to use in your application.

### npm

To install `purecss-sass` npm package execute this command:
```
npm install purecss-sass
```

This will fetch latest version of `purecss-sass` stylesheets to drop into your Sass powered application.

## Usage

By default, using `@import 'purecss';`, all of Pure CSS components are imported.

You can import individual Sass components like this:

```scss
@import 'purecss/base';
@import 'purecss/buttons';
@import 'purecss/forms';
@import 'purecss/grids';
@import 'purecss/grids-responsive';
@import 'purecss/menus';
@import 'purecss/tables';
```

## Versioning
